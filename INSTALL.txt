April 20, 2002


REQUIREMENTS
------------
  SDL
  ---
    "Bug Squish" was programed using the "Simple Direct Media" layer
    libraries by Sam Lantinga.  This means that the game can
    theoretically run under any environment that the SDL libraries support.

      (As of this program's release, this includes: Linux X11/DGA,
      Win32 WinDIB/DirectX, BeOS BWindow, and Solaris X11, as well
      as unofficually supported: Linux SVGAlib, IRIX 6.x X11,
      FreeBSD 3.x X11, and MacOS.)

  SDL_Mixer
  ---------
    Sound and music are available, but are not required (see below).
    You will need the "SDL_Mixer" library compiled and installed
    if you want sound and music.

  SDL_Image
  ---------
    Images are stored as PNG files.  This means you need the "SDL_Image"
    library compiled and installed.

  Controls
  --------
    The game is played with a mouse.

  Downloads
  ---------
    You can download the SDL libraries (REQUIRED) from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/

    You can download SDL_Image (REQUIRED) from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

    You can download SDL_Mixer (OPTIONAL) from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/


INSTALLING UNDER LINUX/UNIX
---------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Note: Read this entire section before you start issuing commands!
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  The "Makefile" that comes with "Bug Squish" assumes a number
  of defaults about your system.  You can edit their values in
  the "Makefile" itself, or specify their values when you run
  the "make" command (ie, "make VARIABLE=value").

  The things you will wish to edit are:

    DATA_PREFIX=$(PWD)/data/

      This defines where "Bug Squish"'s "data/" directory is
      to be found.  The default assumes that you wish to leave
      it where it is right now ("$(PWD)" expands to become the
      current direcotry.

      This variable is useful if you plan on moving the "data/"
      directory elsewhere, say a globally-accessible
      "/usr/local/games/bugsquish-data/".


  To compile the game, type the command:

    make           [ with whatever variable changes you want, if any ]

  If you decided that you wanted the data somewhere else, make sure
  to move it there.  If you wanted it to be accessible to others
  (ie, you're an administrator installing a new game for your users),
  make sure to set the permissions for the files!  (You'll also want
  to move the "bugsquish" binary to somewhere globally accessible,
  and set its permissions, as well, of course!)

  Note: If you do not have the SDL_mixer library, or wish to not
  compile sound support into the game, you can compile it like this:

    make nosound   [ with whatever variable changes you want, if any ]

  If you wish to return the directory to its distribution state,
  (remove the ".o" object files, and the "bugsquish" executable program
  file), you can run:

    make clean


COMPILING FOR WINDOWS USING A CROSS-COMPILER UNDER LINUX/UNIX
-------------------------------------------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Note: Read this entire section before you start issuing commands!
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  Once you are set up to cross-compile (for example, you've installed
  the Xmingw32 cross compiler and set your $PATH variable correctly),
  to compile the game, type the command:

    make win32

  This will re-run the "make" command, sending it some values which
  will replace the Linux-specific defaults in "Makefile".  The resulting
  program will be called "bugsquish.exe".

  The values which are altered when you make the "win32" target are:

    TARGET_LIBS=
      This removes the "-lpthreads" and "-ldl" libraries used under Linux.

    TARGET_DEF=WIN32
      This causes a "WIN32" definition to be sent to the C compiler, which
      changes the source slightly to cross-compile for Windows.

    SDL_PREFIX=/usr/win32/
      Depending on where the Win32 version of the SDL libraries are installed
      on your system, you may need to edit "Makefile" and change the
      "SDL_PREFIX" that gets sent in the "win32" make target.      

    TARGET=bugsquish.exe
      Since Win32 programs are named ".exe", this changes the target filename
      so that such a file is created.

    DATA_PREFIX=
      Since the Linux/Unix directory structure won't make sense on a Win32
      box, the DATA_PREFIX is stripped.  This means "bugsquish.exe" must be
      run inside the directory containing it's "data/" subdirectory.

  If you wish to return the directory to its distribution state,
  (remove the ".o" object files, and the "bugsquish.exe" executable program
  file), you can run:

    make clean


ICON FILE
---------
  A 32x32, XPM-format icon file (using the standard 23-color "cmap.xpm"
  color palette) is available if you wish to use an icon for this game.

  The file is "bugsquish-icon.xpm", and installed in Bug Squish's
  "data/images/" directory.


The End!
